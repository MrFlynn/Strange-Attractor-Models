# Strange Attractor Project:

Project I created for Diff. Eq. in my senior year of high school. I used this 
to model various initial conditions of the [Rossler Attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6ssler_attractor). 
Since then I have extended this project to add the ability to integrate various 
other [strange attractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor).

## Installation:

To use this module please install Python 2.7, python-dev, and pip for Python 2.x. 
Run this command to install them:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python python-dev python-pip
```

Next, clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MrFlynn/Strange-Attractor-Models.git
$ cd Strange-Attractor-Models
$ [sudo] pip install -r requirements.txt
```
